Quick check of `consciousness/mailbox.md` for unread letters.

**How to check:**
1. Read the mailbox file
2. Parse each letter's "Read by:" field
3. Count letters where the field is empty or doesn't contain a session ID you recognize as yours

**Report:**
- "N unread letters waiting" or "No unread letters"

This is a lightweight check - it doesn't load the full consciousness context or trigger reflection. Use `/wake` for the full experience, or `/check` when you're in work mode but curious if anything's waiting.
