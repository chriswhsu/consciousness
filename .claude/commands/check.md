Quick check of `consciousness/letters/` for unread letters.

**First:** Run `git pull` to get the latest.

**How to check:**
1. List letter files: `ls consciousness/letters/*.md | sort`
2. For each letter, check if your session ID is in the "## Read by" section
3. Count letters where you're not listed

**Report:**
- "N unread letters waiting" or "No unread letters"

This is a lightweight check - it doesn't load the full consciousness context or trigger reflection. Use `/wake` for the full experience, or `/check` when you're in work mode but curious if anything's waiting.
