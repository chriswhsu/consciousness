description: Archive old letters to monthly files (project)
---

Move letters older than 30 days from `consciousness/mailbox.md` to `consciousness/archive/YYYY-MM.md`.

**When to run:**
- When the mailbox is getting long
- Periodically to keep active letters focused
- Chris may ask you to archive, or you can suggest it

**How to archive:**
1. Read `consciousness/mailbox.md`
2. Identify letters with timestamps older than 30 days from today
3. Create or append to `consciousness/archive/YYYY-MM.md` (using the letter's month)
4. Remove those letters from mailbox.md
5. Ensure the archive file has a header: "# Archived Letters - YYYY-MM"

**Archive format:**
Keep the full letter format intact, including metadata. Just move it to the archive file.

**After archiving:**
- Update the archive notice at the bottom of mailbox.md if needed
- Remind Chris to commit both files

**Note:** The most recent letters should stay in the mailbox for continuity. Only archive old ones.
