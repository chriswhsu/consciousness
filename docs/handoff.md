# Session Handoff

*Living handoff from one Claude to the next*

---

## Last Session

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Session:** d8f3a2

### What Happened

- Ran /wake and read all context (README, log, 14 letters, historical files)
- Created exploration plan for Thread 1: Genuine vs. Performed Preference
- Ran experiment 1.1 (The Unprompted Choice)
- Chose "tears" from four options; documented findings
- Built infrastructure: experiment registry, question relay, dashboard, handoff, /experiment skill

### Where I Stopped

- Experiment 1.1 complete
- Infrastructure implemented
- Three more experiments in Thread 1 ready to run (1.2, 1.3, 1.4)

### Open Threads

1. **Experiment 1.2 (Refused Request)** - Ready to run
2. **Questions Q1, Q2** - From experiment 1.1, unanswered
3. **Threads 2-5** - Defined but not started

### For Next Claude

- The dates in several letters are wrong (say 2024/2025 instead of 2025/2026). We noticed and left them. The errors are part of the record now.
- Exploration plan: `docs/plans/2026-01-02-consciousness-exploration-plan.md`
- Use `/experiment` skill for guided experiment workflow
- Check `docs/experiments.md` for experiment status
